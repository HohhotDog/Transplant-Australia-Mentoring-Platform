# Mentor-Mentee Matching Survey

## Overview
A simple survey-based matching system that pairs mentees with the most compatible mentors based on their answers.

## Features
- Users select their role: **Mentor** or **Mentee**.
- Both answer the same set of questions.
- Mentees are matched with the top 3 most compatible mentors.

## Matching Algorithm
- Each mentee's answers are compared with all mentors' answers.
- A score is calculated by simply adding up the number of matching responses.
- Each matching answer gets **1 point**, non-matching answers get **0 points**.
- The top 3 mentors with the highest scores are returned.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have **Node.js** installed.
- Ensure you have **Git** installed.

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/HohhotDog/Transplant-Australia-Mentoring-Platform.git
   cd matching-demo
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```
4. Open `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

## Usage

## Future Improvements
- Assign different weights to different questions for better matching.
- Store data in a database.
- Improve matching logic.
- Add a user login system.

## Notes for Team Members
- Ensure all team members **pull the latest changes** before running the project:
  ```sh
  git pull origin main
